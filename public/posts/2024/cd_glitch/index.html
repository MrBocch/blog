        <p>One of the goals I set for my self this year
was to learn rust so that I could build apps with <a href="https://tauri.app/">Tauri</a>.</p>
<p>So I am working my way thrue the rust book when i encounter something very funny.</p>

<p>How is that possible? It appears that I went into the <strong>showcase</strong> directory
then went back to parent directory but change into what appears like a totally random directory???</p>
<h2 id="first-step">First step<a href="#first-step" class="hanchor" ariaLabel="Anchor">&#8983;</a> </h2>
<p>The first step when trying to figure why something
went wrong in software is to try to replicate it.</p>
<p>From what I remembered all that I did up to that point was
create a new directory because I was not sure if Cargo the rust package manager,
would reinstall any library installed from a different project.
After that I deleted the folder because it was no longer needed.</p>
<p>Wait, how did I eliminate the folder?</p>
<p>It all clicked. The issue was I would change directorys using
vscodes terminal window but create and delete the folder thrue
the buttons in vscode (i know mkdir exist its just that i happened to have my hand on the mouse at the time). Because I did not delete the folder thrue the terminal i completly forgot that the showcase directory no long exist because it had been deleted, how can you go up to the parent directory on a directory that does not exist?</p>
<h2 id="what-happens-when-you-delete-something-on-a-computer">What happens when you delete something on a computer?<a href="#what-happens-when-you-delete-something-on-a-computer" class="hanchor" ariaLabel="Anchor">&#8983;</a> </h2>
<p>It appears that when you delete something atleast thrue a GUI that the file does not just dissapear forever, they end up in this directory</p>
<p><code>.local/share/Trash/files</code></p>
<p>I enter the list directory command and I fould hundreds of other files and folders that I had deleted weeks prior. Its in the name
/Trash/files/. This appears to be some sort of trashcan. Knowing this I try to replicate it and it does the exact same thing, noting that it only works when deleting thrue the gui but not thrue &ldquo;rm -rf&rdquo;.</p>
<p>This is when I ask chatgpt and it points me to
<a href="https://www.freedesktop.org">freedesktop.org</a> and
the <a href="https://specifications.freedesktop.org/trash-spec/trashspec-latest.html">trash specification</a>. This little 10 minute
side tangent from learning rust was fun.</p>
<p>ok bai.</p>
