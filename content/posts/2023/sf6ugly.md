## Realism != Good

I cant understand how anybody thinks this looks good.

{{< youtube  d3Erj4Lv_mQ >}}

Its not because of a lack of effort, its the style. It doesn't fit with a street fighter game, the characters are way too reflective, everyone makes a stupid looking faces, plus the ui is ugly, the music sucks, everything sucks.

There are too many colors its distracting. Just look at Street fighter 4, its full of life.

Less is more.
