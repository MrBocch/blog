# 2023

I dont like to make a big deal out of the earth
making a full rotation around the sun, but I like to reflect
on how is the me from January 1st different from the me of
today.

I with out a doubt know more about programming than I did then.

I learned and fell in love with ruby, I understand OOP more than i did then.

With ruby I tackled a little bit of leetcode. From seeking to write more expresive leetcode solutions I decided to look into Haskell.

From reading a Haskell book, I learned what higher order functions actually mean, I understand recursion better, I know what tail call optimization is now.

I learned how to code in a group for a school project. I had to learn a little SQL for this school project.

Yes, this year I have been more productive with learning computer science than any year before, but I feel like I could of done alot more.

I am greatfull for this great year.

## 2024

Here is the game plan.

They are several books that I must read this year, **and actually finish them rather then leave them half read**

- **_Get Programming with Haskell_**, Will Kurt

- **_SICP_** (im really exited about this one, will even follow along with the course on [youtube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-J_xL4IGhJA&list=PLE18841CABEA24090))

- **_The Rust Book_** (I want to try out tauri framework)

- **_Crafting Interpreters_**, Robert Nystrom

- Any book on APL, it looks soo interesting

I image that these books are not the kind you could read in a couple of sittings. They very dense with information and I expect to struggle alot reading them but I believe they will make me a better programmer.

I have other goals outside of programming but I want to keep those for my self ðŸ˜Š.

Anyways here is for a good year.
