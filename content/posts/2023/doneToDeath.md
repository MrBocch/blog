## Throwaway content

I understand that anything that you find on social media is going to be very_low_effort/low_hanging_fruit but that does not mean
we have to continue to hear the same joke over and over. And they're not even funny, at **all**, and potentially harmful

### 1. Cant exit vim

Maybe this bothers me the most because I **loveee** VIM motions (RIP), but cmon.
Nobody is born knowing, but its not like its easy to enter vim by complete accident so there's no excuse not knowing **_literally pressing 3 buttons_** if you enter vim somehow.

This is bad because vim is so simple and amazing with very minimal practice.

### 2. Forgot semicolon

{{< /rawhtml >}}

This one irks me the most. What, do you code in notepad?
With pen and paper? The most basic text editor would catch this.

**ALSO** the compiler would also tell you what function and line. Maybe the people that make these memes also cant read on top of not being funny.

### 3. Code merch

While im here let me talk about this.

Who wears this stuff? The code always manages to be wrong somehow.

### 4. Ranking languages by difficulty

Yes, its "easier" to get started with python than a language like C++
but I believe these sorts of memes gives the wrong idea to people that might be learning how to programing or might be scared off learning a "difficult" language. Its giving ignorant.

### Conclusion

Relatable humor is the worst tragedy of the 21st century.
