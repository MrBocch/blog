Its been a while since I completed reading JoJolion but I just need to say
that it SUCKED!

`warning spoilers ahead`

# 1. Villany

If you are familiar with JoJo's you know that theres no good jojo adventure without a awesome villan,
JoJolion very much lacks this.

Let me just list of some of these previous jojo main antoganist and you will see.

- **Dio Brando**: part 1 and 3 include Dio (a vampire demon) using all sort of evil acts to take over the world.

- **Yoshikage Kira**: Instant fan favorite Yoshikage Kira is a psycho killer, with a stand with the ability to blow shit up + has a "stand awekaning"

So who does JoJolion have as their main antagonist?

**Tooru** who is entirely motivated because a girl was nice to him once I guess.

## 2. Severe lack of JoBro

How can you have a JoJo story without memorable side characters like, Kakyoin, Pierre Polnareff, Giorno's whole gang, Pierre Polnareff as a turtle, Zeppelli, Caesar or Gyro Zeppeli. Reading part 7 you quickly realize there is no JoBro, just the most unlikable guy every conceived with absolutely no redeeming qualities that just hangs out sometimes.

## 3. Plot bro?

Maybe its not fair to part 8 to complain about an exiting plot considering it follows up Steel Ball Run.

Its just very bland in general and hard to care about.
