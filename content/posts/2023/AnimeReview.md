# Welcome

I thought my first post should be something chill, so here is a small list of anime that I like in no particular order

- **K-on**
- **Hitori Bocchi no Marumaru Seikatsu**
- **Azumanga Daioh**
- **Love Lab**
- **No Matter How I Look at It, It's You Guys' Fault I'm Not Popular!**
- **Bocchi the Rock!**
- **Chuunibyou**

The anime I'm into is the sort slice of life, not so serious. Some people think its boring because "nothing happens",
in a sense they are right but thats not the point, just enjoy life bro.
